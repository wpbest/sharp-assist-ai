## Setup and Configure Data Connect
[Configuration Reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect/configuration-reference)

[Figure out all about queries](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/data-connect/gql/query)  

## Add Material Design Schematic
```bash
ng add @angular/material
```


## Add Internationalization Localization (i18n)
```bash
ng add @angular/localize
```

## Add Apollo GraphQL Client Schematic
```bash
ng add apollo-angular
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To install the required packages do:

```base
npm install
```

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
